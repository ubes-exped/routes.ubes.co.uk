[routes.ubes.co.uk](https://routes.ubes.co.uk)
=================

Central repository for the routes.ubes.co.uk project. Provides hosting for the
gpx files, and compiled data that is used for generating the site.

Adding new routes
-----------------

To add a new route, all that is required is a gpx file of the route. The file
must have some metadata in it:

* `<name>` - The name of the route
* `<desc>` - A short description of the route

Optionally add the following tags:

* `<author>` - The person or persons who created the route
* `<keywords>` - Any keyword tags that you think might describe the route, separated by commas.

This gpx file should then be added to the [gpx](gpx) directory.

Compilation
-----------

The compilation step is done by running [compile.py](compile.py), which will
compile all gpx files in the [gpx](gpx) directory and also any gpx files
supplied as command-line argumanets.

The compilation step is automatically performed when new commits are pushed to
this repo, via a github action.

The compilation step takes the provided gpx file, adds/replaces the heights
using [SRTM.py](https://pypi.org/project/SRTM.py), and then renames the file to
a standard form derived from the hash of the polyline of the route.

From each of the standardised gpx files in the [gpx](gpx) directory a json
dictionary is created, which contains:

* The `name` for the route
* The `description` of the route
* An `id` derived from the hash of the combined segments
* The relative path to the `filename` of the gpx route (from the repo root)
* The `author` of the route
* A list of `tags` that apply to the route
* for each of the `segments` in the file:
* A `polyline` of the route
* A `length` of the route
* An `ele` polyline of the route, plotting elevation against distance instead
  of longitude against latitude. These two dimensions are both given in
  hundreds of kilometres (10‚Åµ metres) instead of degrees, so that the encoded
  polyline algorithm can store them as efficiently as possible with a
  resolution of one metre.

These json dictionaries are then concatenated to create
[walks.json](walks.json).
